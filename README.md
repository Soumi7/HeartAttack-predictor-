HeartAttack predictor using Django as backend


A **web based application** with **python**. User inputs their **personal heath data** and the application predicts whether there is a possibilty of heart problem.

The ML model uses **scikit-learn python** library to implement **logistic regression**.

## **The problem it solves**

Many people cannot afford to get tested for heart problems. Sometimes, its better to check out a chest pain as well because it may lead to heart trouble. Using this application you can sit at home and check whether you have to go to the doctor or not.

Nowadays there are a lot of patients with heart problems who dont realize it. They dont have the time to go and get checked at the hospital. These tests cost a lot as well. For people who cannot afford it or dont have the time, this application will be very helpful. We have collected data from a very large data set and trained our machine learning model on that. It gives a 92% percent accuracy on the test set and a similar accuracy on the cross validation set.
